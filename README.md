# 🔧 Fatigue Life Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts the **fatigue strength of steel samples** using machine learning. Fatigue strength refers to the maximum stress a material can endure for a given number of cycles without failing. The model uses **XGBoost regression** on material property data to make accurate predictions.
